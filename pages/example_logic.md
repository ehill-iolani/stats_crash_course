# Example workflow using this website

## Preface

In this section I will outline the thought process I would like you to follow when using this website for guidance as well as the necessary items you need to have completed before you can effectively use this site.

What you should have completed already:
- A well defined research question.
- How you have collected (or intend to collect) your data.
- Your variables.

## Example workflow

My research project is "Is there a notable difference in miles per gallon with between cars with an automatic transmission and cars with an automatic transmission?"

### identifying the broad category of the question

Out of the list of headings, my research question most closely aligns with the overarching question marked in bold:
- ***Is the research question focused on comparing the means of two or more groups?***
- Is the research question focused on comparing proportions or percentages between two or more groups?
- Is the research question focused on determining the relationship between two continuous variables?
- Is the research question focused on determining the relationship between a continuous and a categorical variable?

Knowing my data I know I am comparing the mean miles per gallon between 2 groups (automatic vs manual transmission)

### identifying how/if the groups are related

Out of the list of headings, bold indicates which category the data for my project is most similar to:
- Are the groups independent or related?
  - Are the data normally distributed?
    -  Normally distributed: [t-test](./pages/ttest.md) or [ANOVA](./pages/anova.md)
    -  Not normally distributed: Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test
- Are the groups independent or paired?
