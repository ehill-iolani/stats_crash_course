# Mann-Whitney U

Surprise! This is just another name for the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.


## Wilcoxon rank sum: do two ***unpaired*** populations have the same mean?
  - ***Null hypothesis:*** there is no significant difference between two groups
  - ***Alternative hypothesis:*** there is significant difference between the two groups
