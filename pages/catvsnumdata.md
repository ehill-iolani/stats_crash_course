# What is categorical vs numerical data?

***TL;DR numerical data refers to numbers while categorical data is basically everything else.***

# Categorical data

Categorical data is any data that can be place in a particular category based on its name or label.
For example, if I survey 100 people at a boba shop and ask them what sort of drink they ordered the data I am recording is categorical.
From this data, each person provides exactly one response making their answer mutually exclusive.

Categorical data can be further broken down into ordinal and nominal data.

## Ordinal data

The easiest way to think about ordinal data is that is "score data".
If I asked you "On a scale of 1-10, how much do you like using this website?" Your response would be classified as ordinal data.

## Nominal data

Nominal data is just name data.
The example given above about the drinks ordered from a boba shop is an example of nominal data.

# Numerical data

Numerical data is just numbers in their pure form.
They are not being used to rank anything and they are not being used as descriptors.
For example, if I measure the time it takes for a drop of paint to dry, that would be numerical data.
If I measure the time it takes for a blade of grass to grow 1 mm; that would also be numerical data.

 Much like categorial data, numerical data can also occur in two forms: continuous and discrete data.

## Discrete data

The best way to describe discrete data is to think of it as countable data, like, "How dogs did I see at the park today?"
99.9% of the time you are going to respond with a whole number (in the case where you do not, that situation is not going to be solved with some basic statistics).

## Continuous data

Where discrete data is typically an integer, count data is a measurement where the value can be any real number.
That number can be 1 or 1.23 or 1.234556789.

Within continuous data there are two additional categories: interval and ratio data.

### Interval data

Data that can be measured on a scale like the length of one's left foot or the mass of one's right thumb.

### Ratio data

Data that is measured relative to a "true zero".
For example, how much above or below is your population's body temperature compared to the normal body temperature of 98.6 degrees fahrenheit.
