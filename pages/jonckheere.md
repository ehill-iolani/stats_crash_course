# Jonckheere-Terpstra test

The Jonckheere-Terpstra test is a non-parametric statistical test used to determine whether there is a trend between an ordinal independent variable and a continuous dependent variable.
It is a non-parametric alternative to the one-way ANOVA test for trend analysis.

"Whoa, whoa, wait a second!" I hear you exclaim, "That's what you said about the Kruksal-Wallis test AND the Friedman test too!"

***the Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests are used when the groups are independent and related, respectively, and the dependent variable is continuous but not normally distributed.
The Jonckheere-Terpstra test is used to test for trends in ordinal independent variables with a continuous dependent variable.***
