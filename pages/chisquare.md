# Chi-square

The chi-square test can either test for the independence between two groups or test if a sample is consistent with a known/expected distribution.
This test is extremely useful for analyzing differences in catagorical data and can help determine if the observed results are in line with expected results, and to rule out that observations are due to chance.
These data must be random, independent and drawn from a large(ish) pool (n < 10 ).

### Chi-square test for independence

For this version of the chi-square test, the count data between two groups is compared to see if the counts are independent of each other based on their catagorical assignment.
For example, if you wanted to determine if taking calculus helped students achieve A's in phyiscs the sample would be students in a physics class and the catagories would be "A in physics (Y/N)" and "Taken calculus (Y/N)".
The frequencies between the groups could then be compared.

### Chi-square test for Goodness-of-fit

For this version of the chi-square test, the count data for one group is compared against known/expected count data based on their catagorical assignment.
For example, if you wanted to test if a coin is fair, you would flip a coin 100 times and record H/T.
The frequencies of H/T for your tosses could then be compared to the expected frequencies of 50/50.
